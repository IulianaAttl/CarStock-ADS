# CarStock-ADS

Created a business system in C to keep track of cars in a showroom using C language. Users of this app have the ability to add, delete, update and view car details with the use of a menu. 

The following options are presented to the user:
1. Add a new car to the showroom
2. Sell a car from the showroom
3. Reserve/Unreserve a car in the showroom
4. View all cars in the showroom
5. View a specific car in the showroom
6. This should be an appropriate option that you provide
7. Exit the system

The underlying data structure used in this project is a linked list. The program also contains the ability to support a data file and error checking.
